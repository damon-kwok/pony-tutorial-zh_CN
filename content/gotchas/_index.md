Every programming language has gotchas. Those "wat" moments that make us all laugh when someone does a presentation on them. They often shoot to the top of sites like Hacker News and Reddit. It's all in good fun, except, it isn't. Each of those gotchas and the laughs we get from them, hide someone's pain. This chapter covers some common Pony gotchas that new Pony programmers often stumble across with painful results. Probably the best way to approach this chapter is to imagine each section has a giant flashing "DO NOT DO THIS" sign.
