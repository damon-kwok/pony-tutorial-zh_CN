<!-- If you are reading this tutorial in order, you've just finished the reference capabilities chapter and your brain probably hurts. We're sorry about that. Hopefully object capabilities, while a new concept, are less mind bending.  -->
如果您正在按顺序阅读本教程，那么您刚刚完成了参考功能一章，您的大脑可能会感到疼痛。我们对此表示抱歉。希望对象能力，虽然是一个新概念，是较少的精神弯曲。

<!-- We touched on object capabilities previously in the tutorial, this chapter will dig in more. So, what is an object capability? -->
我们在之前的教程中提到过对象功能，本章将深入探讨。那么，什么是对象功能？

<!-- A capability is the ability to do "something". Usually that "something" involves an external resource that you might want access to; like the filesystem or the network. This is called an object capability. Object capabilities have appeared in a number of programming languages including [E](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_%28programming_language%29). -->
能力是做"某事"的能力。通常，"某物"涉及您可能希望访问的外部资源;比如文件系统或网络。这称为对象功能。对象功能已经出现在许多编程语言中，包括[E](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_%28programming_language%29)。
