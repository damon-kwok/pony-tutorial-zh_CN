<!-- This chapter will get you up and running with Pony from installing the compiler to running your first program.  -->
本章将带你开始使用Pony，安装编译器运行第一个程序。

<!-- As you work your way through this tutorial, you'll likely come across a lot of concepts that are familiar to you from any prior programming languages that you've had experience with. You'll likely want to skim and skip around through these areas, and that's totally fine. -->
在本教程的学习过程中，你可能会遇到已经熟悉的概念，想跳过这些章节完全没问题。

<!-- However, if you've never used Pony before, we guarantee that you'll come across concepts that are new to you, which will require close and careful attention if you want to learn and apply them: [reference capabilities]({{< relref "reference-capabilities/_index.md" >}}). These are the core innovation in Pony that make it a unique and compelling offering in the wide world of modern programming languages. -->
不过，如果你第一次接触Pony肯定会遇到陌生的概念，如果想使用Pony，你需要`特别！特别！！注意`：[引用权能]({{< relref "reference-capabilities/_index.md" >}})章节。__引用权能__ 是Pony的核心，凭借着`特立独行`的思想使Pony在现代编程语言的中`脱颖而出`。
<!-- 这是Pony语言的核心思想，这些`特立独行`的思想使Pony在众多的现代编程语言的中脱颖而出。 -->

<!-- In this tutorial we start off with familiar basics, and try our best to avoid reference capabilities in the code examples until later on when they can be covered in detail. You should feel free to follow along with the code examples in your own text editor - we absolutely encourage it. Just be aware that as you venture off the beaten path of the curated tutorial, you'll likely run into reference capabilities, and you'll need to thoroughly read and understand the basics of those concepts before you'll really feel fluent and able to work with the compiler as it tries to help you prove the safety of your program. -->
在本教程从熟悉的基础知识入手，会尽力避免在代码示例中使用 __引用权能__ ，然后循序渐进的对其介绍。阅读过程中，强烈建议你将教程中的代码在自己的编辑器中敲一遍。注意，当你冒然跳跃式阅读本教程时，可能会遇到 __引用权能__ ，想要流畅的通读全文，得先彻底理解 __引用权能__ 。学习过程中配合编译器一起使用，可以验证教程中代码示例，加深理解。

<!-- Stick with us and read on, even if you need to read through something a few times. Know that the community is here to help as you climb the learning curve and master new concepts that will change the way you think about concurrency. -->
或许你正急着阅读后面的章节，稍微花点时间读完入门章节，了解下社区为你提供了哪些帮助，可以少走一些弯路。学习Pony会改变你对并发问题的看法。
