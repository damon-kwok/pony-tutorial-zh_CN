<!-- This chapter will get you up and running with Pony from installing the compiler to running your first program.  -->
本章将带您开始使用Pony，安装编译器运行第一个程序。

<!-- As you work your way through this tutorial, you'll likely come across a lot of concepts that are familiar to you from any prior programming languages that you've had experience with. You'll likely want to skim and skip around through these areas, and that's totally fine. -->
在学习本教程的过程中，您可能会遇到许多您曾经使用过的编程语言所熟悉的概念。您可能会想跳过这些章节，这完全没问题。

<!-- However, if you've never used Pony before, we guarantee that you'll come across concepts that are new to you, which will require close and careful attention if you want to learn and apply them: [reference capabilities](/reference-capabilities.html). These are the core innovation in Pony that make it a unique and compelling offering in the wide world of modern programming languages. -->
不过，如果您以前从未使用过Pony，您肯定会遇到一些陌生的概念，如果想学习和应用Pony，你需要`特别！特别！！的注意`：[引用权能](/reference- abilities.html)章节。__引用权能__ 是Pony的核心，它让Pony`独步天下`。
<!-- 这是Pony语言的核心思想，这些`特立独行`的思想使Pony在众多的现代编程语言的中脱颖而出。 -->

<!-- In this tutorial we start off with familiar basics, and try our best to avoid reference capabilities in the code examples until later on when they can be covered in detail. You should feel free to follow along with the code examples in your own text editor - we absolutely encourage it. Just be aware that as you venture off the beaten path of the curated tutorial, you'll likely run into reference capabilities, and you'll need to thoroughly read and understand the basics of those concepts before you'll really feel fluent and able to work with the compiler as it tries to help you prove the safety of your program. -->
在本教程中，我们先从熟悉的基础知识入手，会尽力避免在代码示例中使用 __引用权能__ ，然后循序渐进的对其进行详细介绍。阅读过程中，强烈建议你将教程中的代码示例，在自己的文本编辑器中敲一遍。请注意，当您冒然跳跃式阅读本教程时，可能会遇到 __引用权能__ ，想要流畅的通读全教程，必须得先彻底理解这个基础概念。学习过程中配合编译器一起使用，可以帮助你验证教程中代码示例可用性。

<!-- Stick with us and read on, even if you need to read through something a few times. Know that the community is here to help as you climb the learning curve and master new concepts that will change the way you think about concurrency. -->
或许你正急着阅读后面的章节，还请花点时间读完入门章节。你需要了解下社区为你提供了帮助，帮你学习新概念时少走弯路，这将改变你对并发问题的看法。
